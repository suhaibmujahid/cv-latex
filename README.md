# Latex CV Template

## Download Compiled PDF

To download the latest compiled PDF file:

- Open the **Actions** tab.
- Then, select the latest commit workflow (the first item in the list).
- You should see an artifact file named `REPOSITORY_NAME-PDF`; click on it to download a `zip` file that contains the pdf file.

By default, Github will delete artifact files after 90 days. If the last commit is older than 90 days, it probably does not have the PDF file. You can click on `Re-run all jobs` to rebuild the commit.
